# Changelog

All notable changes to AgentBox are documented here.

## Unreleased — Developer Preview (MVP)

### Added
- CLI: `init`, `run`, `policy check`, `mcp scan`/`mcp list`, `session list`/`show`/`replay`, `doctor`, `version`.
- YAML policy engine with secure defaults, strict loading, validation, and an
  `EffectivePolicy` (deny-overrides-allow, mandatory sensitive denies, unsafe-mode gating).
- Runtime abstraction: dry-run runner, Docker runner (non-root, never privileged,
  never mounts the Docker socket, `deny` → `--network none`), and an unsafe local runner.
- Agent adapters: `custom` (templated `{{ task }}`) and `aider`, with a registry
  and availability checks.
- Session recorder: full `session.json` schema plus `report.md`, redacted `logs.txt`,
  `diff.patch`, `policy-events.json`, `test-results.txt`, and `metadata.json`.
- Secret redaction: named env values plus built-in/extra regex patterns, applied to
  every persisted artifact.
- MCP Guard static scanner with stable rule IDs (shell, env/secrets, filesystem,
  network, database, git, prompt-injection), human and JSON output, exit 2 on unsafe.
- Git integration: repo detection, diff (including agent-created files), changed-file
  attribution, branch/commit, remote normalization/clone, and `gh`-based PR creation.
- Disposable, sanitized workspace copy (denied files excluded; `.git` preserved).
- Unsafe-mode confirmation flow (interactive prompt / `--yes-unsafe` for CI; exit 8).
- GitHub composite action and a safe, dry-run-by-default example workflow.
- Security acceptance tests mapping to the threat model (§8).

### Known limitations
- `network: allowlist` is not enforced yet (falls back to `deny`, advisory list).
- `commands.deny` is best-effort; `budget` USD/token caps depend on adapter support.
- Real container execution requires a runtime image you build; podman is not implemented.
- Secret redaction is best-effort and may miss unknown formats.
